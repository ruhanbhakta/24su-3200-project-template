# FreshMeet- A Co-op Insights Tool

## About

Picture this: you’re a college student, anxious and unsure as you navigate your first co-op search with no experience and little guidance. Or maybe you’re a recruiter, spending countless hours sorting through unqualified candidates and struggling to find the right fit for your growing company. And then there’s the co-op advisor—overwhelmed, managing hundreds of students, each needing unique support, with no efficient way to keep up.
Enter FreshMeet, the data-driven platform poised to revolutionize how co-ops are experienced. This app tackles the biggest pain points in the current system: the disorganized, stressful hunt for the right opportunities, inefficient hiring processes, and the struggle for personalized guidance in a sea of students. With FreshMeet, students get personalized dashboards that track their applications and skill progress, making the job search feel less like a maze and more like a clear path to success.
Built for students seeking their first chance and advisors who need a powerful yet simple management tool, FreshMeet is here to elevate the co-op experience from frustration to seamless connection. FreshMeet is your next big investment. FreshMeet brings desperately needed order and data insights to the Northeastern co-op experience.
